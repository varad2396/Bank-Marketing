Project: Bank Marketing Campaign Prediction

Built multiple machine learning models on the UCI Bank Marketing dataset to predict customer term deposit subscription likelihood. Applied techniques including Logistic Regression, Ridge Classifier, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Boosting with extensive hyperparameter tuning.

Baseline Logistic Regression achieved 66.8% accuracy, while regularized and ensemble methods significantly improved results. The Boosting (Tuned) model achieved the best performance (Test Accuracy: 89.28%) with balanced generalization, closely followed by the Ridge Classifier and Random Forest (Tuned).

Key Techniques: Data Preprocessing, Regularization, Ensemble Learning, Hyperparameter Tuning, Model Evaluation
Tools Used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
